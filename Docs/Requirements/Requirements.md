# Quality Management System (QMS/SAC) Requirements

## Objective

Centralize and efficiently manage the documents of the Quality Management System (QMS) or Quality Assurance System (SAC), migrating the system from serverjz to the Intranet and ensuring compliance with ISO9001:2015. The system must allow the creation, review, approval, distribution, and archiving of documents, guaranteeing traceability and regulatory compliance.

## Scope

- Review and analysis of the current system (documents and HTML).
- Design and implementation of a centralized and accessible solution on the Intranet.
- Implementation of version control, permissions, and change traceability.
- Compliance with ISO9001:2015.
- Prioritized migration of critical documents (policies, procedures, audits, etc.).

## Functional Requirements

- User control and role management (see User Roles and Permissions section).
- Document management: creation, review, approval, distribution, archiving, and deletion.
- Version management and change traceability.
- Advanced and efficient document search.
- Intuitive and user-friendly interface for users and administrators.
- Change tracking and process auditing.
- Secure and reliable access control to documents.
- Viewing, downloading, and consulting documents according to permissions.
- Chain approval management and document status control.
- Archiving and access to previous document versions.
- User manual and technical documentation.

## Non-Functional Requirements

- Information security and data backup.
- Integrity and authenticity of documents.
- Compatibility with modern browsers and existing systems.
- Adequate performance for large volumes of documents.
- Ease of maintenance, scalability, and updates.
- Access via Intranet or local network, without compromising confidentiality.
- Support for future integrations and APIs.

## User Roles and Access Levels

- **Level 3: Approver user** – Reviews and approves documents (first approval level).
- **Level 4: Document administrator** – Creates, edits, approves, deletes documents, and manages versions and auditing.
- **Level 5: System administrator** – Manages users, configures the system, and performs security audits.

## Permissions and Access Control

- Assignment of specific permissions by user level.
- Access control to functionalities according to role.
- Access to previous versions and control of document reliability and integrity.
- User management: creation, review, and approval.

## Standards and Regulations

## Success Criteria

- End-user satisfaction and meeting deadlines.
- Quality and compliance of generated documentation.
- Security, integrity, and system performance.
- Ability to handle large volumes of documents.
- Generation of reports and performance metrics.

## Risks and Limitations
